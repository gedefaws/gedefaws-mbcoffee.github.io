### ðŸŒ± From Guji, Ethiopia to Your Cup

**MB Coffee** is a family-owned business rooted in the highlands of Guji. We grow and export high-quality green coffee beans directly to specialty roasters in North America.

We believe in transparency, sustainability, and traceability â€” and weâ€™re proud to share our farmâ€™s story with the world.
