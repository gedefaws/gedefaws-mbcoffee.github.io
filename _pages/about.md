### Our Story

MB Coffee is a family-run coffee business rooted in the rich soil of **Guji, Ethiopia**.

For generations, our family has grown and harvested coffee with care, passion, and respect for the land. We specialize in **high-quality green coffee beans**, handpicked at peak ripeness and processed with precision.

We work directly with roasters to bring authentic Guji flavor to their customers — without middlemen or mass-market dilution.
